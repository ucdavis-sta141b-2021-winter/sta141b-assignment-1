```{r, echo = FALSE}
options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cran.rstudio.com"))
```

It is a quick exercise for you to get familiar with RStudio, Rmarkdown and GitHub. 


##### (a) Make sure you have R 4.0 or above!!

```{r}
R.version.string
```

##### (b) Make sure you have updated all your packages!

```{r}
old.packages(checkBuilt = TRUE)
```

Hint: Use the RStudio interface or by running `update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)` in the Console to update the outdated packages.


##### (c) Create an R block by (Ctrl + Alt + I) or (Cmd + Alt + I) if you are on macOS. In the R block, write a R function `sum_of_squares` which gives
$$
\text{sum_of_squares}(x, y) = x^2 + y^2
$$


```{r}
stopifnot(sum_of_squares(3, 4) == 25)
```
